Stellarium is a free open source planetarium for your computer. It shows a realistic sky
in 3D, just like what you see with the naked eye, binoculars or a telescope.

## This Fork

This fork wants to improve Stellarium in 2 ways.

1. More modern C++, less Qt. Most old Qt components can be replaced by Standard C++'s, increases robustness and portability,
2. Refactor the StelMain. Extract a StelCore out with essential features and less dependencies, make it earier to integrate into other projects.
